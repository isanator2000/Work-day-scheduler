# Work day scheduler

## Description
This is a scheduler. It lets you write activities planned out for specific hours throughout the day, and save them so that won't get deleted if you refresh the page. This uses jQuery. 


## Usage

To use this scheduler, simply click on the box corresponding to the hour you want, and start typing. As you type, the text will show on the box. To save, click on the save icon corresponding to that box. You can now refresh and what you typed will still be there.
